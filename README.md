## üìú Overview

This project presents an end-to-end pipeline for classifying events (e.g., 'human', 'car', 'nothing') based on time-series data collected from geophone sensors. Utilizing **PyTorch**, the core of the solution is a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** enhanced with a **Spatial Attention mechanism**. The pipeline handles raw signal processing, feature extraction via **Log Power Spectrograms**, advanced data augmentation, model training, and evaluation, achieving high classification accuracy even in potentially noisy environments.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Highlights

*   **Custom PyTorch CNN Architecture:** Features multiple convolutional blocks with BatchNorm, ReLU, and MaxPool, tailored for spectrogram analysis.
*   **Spatial Attention Mechanism:** Allows the model to focus on the most informative time-frequency regions within the spectrograms, boosting performance.
*   **Log Power Spectrogram Features:** Transforms raw time-series signals into a rich 2D representation using STFT (`scipy.signal`), suitable for CNNs.
*   **Advanced Data Augmentation:**
    *   Basic time-domain augmentation (noise, shift, scale).
    *   **SpecAugment** applied on-the-fly during training (frequency/time masking, noise, shifts, cutout) via a custom PyTorch Dataset/DataLoader for enhanced robustness.
*   **Intelligent Channel Selection:** Utilizes Cross-Correlation analysis to identify and discard noisy or unreliable sensor channels before feature extraction.
*   **High Classification Accuracy:** Achieved **92.9%** overall accuracy on the held-out test set. *(See Results section for details)*
*   **End-to-End Pipeline:** Covers data loading, robust preprocessing, feature engineering, efficient training loop (with AdamW, LR scheduling, Early Stopping), and detailed evaluation.

## üìä Pipeline Workflow

1.  **Data Loading & Organization:** Loading raw signal CSVs, handling exceptions (corrupted files), parsing labels from filenames.
2.  **Channel Quality Analysis:** Performing Cross-Correlation between channels (especially vs. 'nothing' signals) and variance analysis to identify and select reliable sensor channels.
3.  **Signal Windowing & Augmentation (Time-Domain):** Segmenting signals into overlapping windows and applying basic time-domain augmentations.
4.  **Feature Engineering (Spectrograms):** Generating Log Power Spectrograms for each window using STFT.
5.  **Data Preparation (PyTorch):**
    *   Label Encoding.
    *   Reshaping spectrograms for CNN input (B, C, H, W).
    *   Splitting into stratified Train/Validation/Test sets.
    *   Creating custom `Dataset` & `DataLoader` with **on-the-fly SpecAugment** for training batches.
6.  **CNN Model Development:** Defining the custom CNN architecture with Spatial Attention in PyTorch.
7.  **Training & Optimization:**
    *   Using `CrossEntropyLoss` and `AdamW` optimizer.
    *   Implementing `ReduceLROnPlateau` learning rate scheduler.
    *   Implementing `EarlyStopping` based on validation accuracy.
    *   Training loop with validation checks.
8.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the best model on the Test set using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (`classification_report`), and Confusion Matrix.
9.  **Visualization:** Plotting training curves and the confusion matrix.
